## Groups

The scope of the app we describe in these guidelines is for a solo work.

You can work in groups but in this case we will expect an application with more features or more complex features.

Each group and subject needs to be validate with us to ensure that the complexity of the app is compliant with the group size.

::: tip Submit subjects

After reading all the guidelines, you can begin to search for subjects, form groups, and fill [this form](https://forms.gle/QgLX836A9KjQxGoK8).

If you are not sure about your answers, don't worry, we can check them together next week and adapt them ;)
