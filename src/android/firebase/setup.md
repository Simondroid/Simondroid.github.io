# Setup

Firebase is an app development platform developed by Google. 

It offers a lot of features but we will only use the essential ones.

If you are interested about what Firebase has to offer, you can check [this page](https://firebase.google.com/products-build). Most features are either free or have a generous free-tier.

## Create the project

We will create a Firebase project for each group. We should already have provided it to you, if it's not the case ask us.

Then follow the `Option 1: Add Firebase using the Firebase console` steps (since we created a project for you, you can skip the first step).
:::

When creating your Firebase project, enable Google Analytics. Without any more work you will automatically have basic analytics in the Firebase console!

To test this step, you only need to check that your app still launchs correctly on your device after adding Firebase to it.
