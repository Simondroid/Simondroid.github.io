[Compose navigation](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-navigation)

In this code labs, you will learn how to navigate between different views in an Android application.
:::

Once you are familiar enough with navigation, you can create a second view in your application.

When the user clicks on a element of the list, he/she is redirected to this second view which displays more details about the selected item.

For the movies example, the list view could display only the title and the details view could display the synopsis in addition to the title.

::: tip Feel free to go off-track ðŸ’¡

If you have a precise idea of what you want your application to do, you don't need to do exactly as described.

The minimum requirement is 2 screens with navigation and a list in one of those screens.
