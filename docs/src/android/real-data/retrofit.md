[Retrofit with MVVM](https://saurabhjadhavblogs.com/retrofit-with-mvvm-in-jetpack-compose)

This time, we think that an article will be more interesting for you than codelabs.

Indeed, codelabs don't use complex architecture, so you would need to do several codelabs and then try to link things together, which can be very difficult.

So we propose this article, which presents something close to what we use. The author puts everything in the app module but you will need to split things between modules.

It's quite strange than the author provides all his `build.gradle` at the beginning of his article. You only need to import the needed dependencies. Try to use the last version available.

Try to use what the article presents to get data with Retrofit from the API you chose and display them in your views instead of your fake data.
